ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

From zeo-data-contract:
* AndroidManifest.xml
* LICENSE-2.0.txt
* ant.properties
* build.xml
* proguard.cfg
From zeo-sleep-csv:
* LICENSE-2.0.txt
* ant.properties
* build.xml
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

In zeo-data-contract:
* src\ => zeodatacontract\src\main\java\
In zeo-sleep-csv:
* AndroidManifest.xml => zeosleepcsv\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* res\ => zeosleepcsv\src\main\res\
* src\ => zeosleepcsv\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
